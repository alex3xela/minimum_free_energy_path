You have to use main_linear_input.m with Matlab.

Input: ligandMatrix.txt 

To generate the initial path, we need to define:
  - NC		       number of initial clusters
  - newNC 	       number of final clusters
  - smoothing factor   
  - boundaries_id

Output: physical_medoids.txt

NB: clean the doubles of physical_medoids.txt using remove_duplicates.sh
