README equidistant_frames_for_path_cv

What it does:
The program equidistant_frames_for_pcv applies the equidistant waypoint algorithm.
It uses a steered MD protocol to optimize the distance (in terms of RMSD) between consecutive frames.
As a result, an approximate minimum free energy path composed by equidistant frames is obtained, allowing the smooth progression of the path CVs along the path. 

INPUTS:

  1. GRO files extracted from the original trajectory in 03.extract
     (you can copy the GRO files in this directory using: "bash copy_gro_files.sh")

  2. input.ini (fill input file with your parameters as explained)

  3. Modify steered_md_template.mdp as needed


OUTPUT: 
  
  1. path_reference.pdb: multimodel pdb file describing the uniform path of the ligand.
      It is ready to be used for successive enhanched sampling methods with PCVs.
        - CA of protein residues are associated to occupancy equal to 1.00
        - ligand atoms are associated to beta equal to 1.00   
        - the selection of atoms of all frames optimized with steered MD are written in path_reference.pdb

  2. GRO files of each frame optimised

  3. equidistant_frames.log: lof file where all steps are written to follow the evolution of the program
 

Optional to improve the sampling of the path during successive simulations:
Add a cap at the beginning and at the end of the path by interpolating the first 2 and last 2 configurations of the original path 
EX. extreme_path.tcl

[Paths]
In this section, define your paths for gromacs and plumed that will be used to make the frames equidistant
If not in this directory, remember to specoify the full paths of your topology and index files needed for the MD run

[Script Paramters]
equidistance_nm = equidistance between consecutive frames in nm (normally, 0.1 nm = 1 Angstrom)

[Plumed Parameters]
Two different CVs are used: RMSD with respect to the previous station, RMSD with respect to the next station (explain why)
The KAPPA for the steered MD must be defined for each CV (the one related to RMSD with respect to the previous station should be x10-100 times higher)
